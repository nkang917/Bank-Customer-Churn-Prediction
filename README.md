# Bank customer churn prediction
•	Developed algorithms to predict bank customer churn probability based on labeled data using Python.

•	Preprocessed dataset by data cleansing, categorical feature transformation and standardization, etc.

•	Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN and XGBoost.

•	Optimized hyper-parameters with k-fold cross-validation and applied regularization to overcome overfitting.

•	Evaluated model performance of classification and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results.
